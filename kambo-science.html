                <h2 class="sm-heading" data-aos="fade-down">Italian scientist and Nobel Prize nominee Vittorio Erspamer </h2>
                <p data-aos="fade-down">of the University of Rome was the first to analyze Kambo in a laboratory. In 1986, he described it as containing a “fantastic chemical cocktail with potential medical applications, unequalled by any other amphibian.”  The chemicals he identified were peptides—short chain amino acids that are the building blocks of proteins in the body. As essential components of our biology, alongside water and proteins, peptides play a crucial role in maintaining our overall health. While scientists have been able to isolate and synthesize some of Kambo's peptides, there is no true substitute for the natural substance and once the frogs are removed from their natural habitat they no longer produce their secretion.</p>

                    <div class="main-details">
                        <p data-aos="fade-down">
                            While Kambo’s traditional use is well-documented, modern research is now focused on isolating and characterizing its bioactive compounds, as well as exploring potential medical applications. To date, at least 70 medical patents have been submitted based on compounds derived from Kambo, highlighting its promising potential in areas such as:

                <div class="full-box">
                    <p data-aos="fade-down">Some of the peptides in Kambo are neuropeptides, meaning they directly affect the brain and body by communicating with neurons. Neuropeptides such as insulin, oxytocin, and endorphins are essential to our physiological functions. Other peptides found in Kambo are bioactive, made up of specific amino acid chains that the body recognizes as beneficial. At a cellular level, the body opens up to Kambo, allowing it to cleanse deposits left by foreign substances without causing cellular stress.</p>
                    <p data-aos="fade-down">Kambo also contains potent antimicrobial peptides that have shown potential in fighting antibiotic-resistant bacteria, fungi, and viruses, positioning Kambo as a promising natural treatment for infections that are difficult to address with conventional antibiotics. This broad antimicrobial action enhances the body’s defenses and may contribute to overall vitality and resilience.</p>
                    <p data-aos="fade-down">Additionally, some neuropeptides in Kambo are thought to promote neuroplasticity, which is the brain's ability to form new neural connections and reorganize itself. This potential could make Kambo helpful for those recovering from trauma, managing neurological conditions, or seeking to enhance cognitive function and mental clarity.</p>
                    <p data-aos="fade-down">Kambo peptides are also known to modulate the immune system, promoting a balanced response and helping to combat inflammation—a key factor in many chronic illnesses. By regulating the body’s inflammatory responses, Kambo may offer relief from conditions linked to chronic inflammation and immune system dysfunction.</p>
                    <p data-aos="fade-down">This unique combination of peptides serves as a "key" that unlocks the body's defenses, enabling Kambo to cross the blood-brain barrier rather than being filtered out by the body’s natural systems. This makes Kambo an exceptionally powerful tool for reaching and addressing disease.</p>
                    <p data-aos="fade-down">The main families of bioactive peptides identified in the Kambo secretion so far include:</p>
                    <p data-aos="fade-down">Phyllomedusin: a tachykinin which affects the salivary glands, tear ducts, intestines, and bowels. It contracts the smooth muscles and increases sections of the entire gastrointestinal tract such as the pancreas and gallbladder, and contributes to purging.</p>
                    <p data-aos="fade-down">Phyllocaerulein: stimulates the pituitary gland and adrenal cortex. Causes a contraction of the gall bladder which in turn secretes gastric and pancreatic juices. Both Phyllocaeurulein and Sauvagine (below) have great analgesic properties that contribute to an increase in physical strength, pain tolerance, disease, stress and diminish fatigue.</p>
                    <p data-aos="fade-down">Sauvagine: has an effect of the cortico releasing hormone system and pituitary adrenal axis. This plays a role in balancing mood, stress, and impulsive behaviour. Sauvagine also works to improve the digestion and also has analgesic properties that help with pain in renal colic, pain due to peripheral vascular insufficiency and tumour pain. </p>
                    <p data-aos="fade-down">Deltorphin: an opioid - like peptide that is known to have quite strong analgesic properties that block pain without creating an abuse potential or dependance. 4000 times stronger than morphine and 30-40 times stronger than b-endorphins (the body's natural pain killer). </p>
                    <p data-aos="fade-down">Phyllokinin and Phyllomedusin: potent blood vessel dilators that also increase the permeability of the blood-brain barrier. Within this family are the medusins, which have antimcrobial and anti fungal properties.</p>
                    <p data-aos="fade-down">Adenoregulin: stimulate the adenosine receptors which are fundamental component throughout all human cellular fuel. These receptors may offer a target for the treatment of depression, stroke and cognitive loss diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease and also Parkinson’s.</p>
                    <p data-aos="fade-down">Dermaseptin: a potent antimicrobial found to combat viruses, bacteria, fungi and protozoa. Studies have shown Dermaseptin to be effective at killing and inhibiting cancer cells. It also kills pathogens such HIV, Candida, herpes, and E. coli. </p>
