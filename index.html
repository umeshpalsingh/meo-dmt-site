                    <p data-aos="fade-down">Kambo, the secretion of the Giant Green Monkey Tree Frog (Phyllomedusa Bicolor), is a remarkable natural
                        substance with a complex blend of bioactive peptides. These peptides interact with specific receptors in
                        the human body, working in harmony to help restore balance and support overall well-being. When applied
                        correctly, Kambo can provide deep healing benefits—physically, emotionally, and energetically.
                    </p>
                    <p data-aos="fade-down">Scientists have identified 16 unique peptides in Kambo so far, and its potential has even sparked over 70
                        patents within the pharmaceutical industry, aiming to replicate its therapeutic effects. Yet, unlike
                        synthetic medications, Kambo is naturally recognized by the body, leaving no harmful residues. In fact,
                        it has been known to help cleanse pharmaceutical toxins from the body, promoting a sense of renewal.
                    </p>
                    <p data-aos="fade-down">Free from allergens and toxins, Kambo is safe when administered by a trained practitioner, offering a natural pathway toward holistic healing</p>

                    <p data-aos="fade-down">
                        The core purpose of a Kambo Ceremony is to bring balance to all the body’s systems, promoting detoxification on both physical and emotional levels. Physically, the bioactive peptides in Kambo work to fortify the immune system, reduce inflammation, and alleviate pain. These peptides also cleanse the lymphatic system, which boosts vitality, enhances natural beauty, and sharpens mental clarity. By optimizing bodily functions, Kambo helps the body return to its natural state of homeostasis. Many claim it has been a helpful therapy for loosing weight and reducing food cravings.​

            <div class="full-box">
                <p data-aos="fade-down">Emotionally, Kambo facilitates the release of traumas, negative thought patterns, and energetic blockages. Many people have reported its benefits in addressing anxiety, depression, PTSD, and other psychological challenges. One of the most remarkable aspects of Kambo is its responsiveness to the individual’s intentions set before a ceremony. This innate intelligence allows the experience to be tailored to the person's unique emotional and spiritual needs.</p>
                <p data-aos="fade-down">Despite the brief discomfort during the ceremony, the long-lasting benefits are often profound.</p>
                <p data-aos="fade-down">For more information about the practicalities of the Kambo process click below</p>
                <a data-aos="fade-down" class="button-main" href="kambo-saftey.html">Kambo Ceremony</a>
                <p data-aos="fade-down">
                    Traditionally, Kambo was used by Amazonian tribes to strengthen the body and reduce human scent, aiding hunters in the jungle. It was also valued for its ability to purify the mind and spirit by removing "Panema," a term for negative energies believed to cause lethargy, depression, and bad luck. Kambo was a key tool for eliminating these influences and bringing renewal.
                </p>
                <p data-aos="fade-down">Kambo’s powerful anti-inflammatory, antibiotic, antiviral, and antimicrobial properties stem from its high concentration of peptides, which work synergistically to detoxify the body. These peptides and neuropeptides have the potential to address a range of health and emotional conditions. As we release the blockages and negative influences accumulated from past experiences, we naturally begin to express a more authentic version of ourselves. This process allows our true essence—one of love, peace, and strength—to emerge as we let go of false beliefs in our unworthiness, weakness, or fear.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="c-flex">
                <div class="main-details">
                    <p data-aos="fade-down">
                        Kambo not only restores balance but also enhances overall well-being, even for those not suffering from specific conditions. Many participants report improvements in their physical, emotional, and spiritual lives. Some of the commonly experienced benefits include:
                    </p>

                        <li data-aos="fade-right">Heightened senses</li>

                        <li data-aos="fade-right">Reduced stress and anxiety</li>

                    <p data-aos="fade-down">
                        Through the deep work of Kambo, individuals often find themselves more in tune with their true nature, experiencing renewed vitality and clarity in both mind and spirit.

                <p data-aos="fade-down">A Full Kambo Ceremony typically lasts between 2-3 hours. To ensure the process goes smoothly, it’s important to prepare your body beforehand. You’ll need to fast for at least 10 hours prior to the ceremony, meaning no food, and avoid drinking water for 2 hours before the start. Please refrain from taking any medications or supplements on the morning of your ceremony; if necessary, bring them with you to take afterward, but be sure to have them cleared beforehand, as certain medications may interact with Kambo.</p>
                <p data-aos="fade-down">The ceremony begins in a safe and protected space where you’ll have the opportunity to express your intention and share how you are feeling before the Kambo is applied.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="c-flex">
                <div class="content-img">
                    <img src="assets/images/kambo-ceremony.webp" width="350" height="440" alt="kambo-ceremony" data-aos="zoom-in-down">

                <div class="main-details">
                    <p data-aos="fade-down">
                        Together, we will decide the location on your body where you’ll receive the Kambo. For first-time participants, we perform a “Basic Treatment,” applying the Kambo to traditional points on either the upper arm or lower leg, as practiced by the Amazonian tribes. After your initial ceremony, you’ll have the option to receive Kambo in other areas during future sessions.
                    </p>
                    <p data-aos="fade-down">
                        Many people choose to have Kambo applied to body areas that align with their intention, such as a chakra point, meridian point, or a location tied to a past injury. Areas closer to the heart and spine tend to bring about a faster reaction, initiating the purging process more quickly. Once the location is selected, I will use a small unscented incense stick to lightly burn the first layer of skin. This quick and minor sensation is necessary to open the pathway for Kambo to enter the lymphatic system.
                    </p>
                    <p data-aos="fade-down">Once this is done, you will drink water to prepare your body. Afterward, the Kambo will be applied to the skin, and the process will begin. If it’s your first time receiving Kambo, I will apply a test point to check for any adverse reactions, ensuring your safety throughout the experience.​​</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="c-flex">
                <div class="main-details">
                    <p data-aos="fade-down">
                        Within minutes of Kambo being applied, the body will undergo a range of sensations, including changes in temperature, a quickened heartbeat, dizziness, fatigue, and a temporary rise in blood pressure. Shortly after, the blood pressure will drop, and the purging process may begin. Extreme nausea is common, and purging typically occurs through vomiting or needing to use the toilet. However, it’s also possible to purge through shaking sensations that move through the nervous system, or by releasing emotions. Throughout the entire process, I will be there to hold space for you, ensuring your safety and supporting you.
                    </p>
                    <p data-aos="fade-down">It’s important to note that Kambo is not a psychedelic substance. Unlike other traditional Amazonian medicines, it does not induce visions or facilitate journeying. The experience is primarily physical, and while it can be uncomfortable and challenging, it is relatively brief, typically lasting 20-40 minutes. This process requires a degree of surrender and acceptance of the temporary discomfort.</p>
                </div>

            </div>
            <p data-aos="fade-down">
                For those healthy enough to receive Kambo and who do not have any contraindications, there is very little risk involved. The process is intense but safe when facilitated properly.

                <p data-aos="fade-down">Once the purging process is complete, the Kambo is removed from the skin. Within minutes, the feelings of nausea will begin to subside, and you’ll be able to lay down and rest for about 30 minutes. During this time, I can also offer Sananga eye drops—a yellow liquid made from the roots of the Tabernaemontana Sanana, a shrub native to the Amazon Jungle. Traditionally, Sananga is used to improve eyesight, clear negative energy around the head, and decalcify the pineal gland. After you’ve had time to rest, I will serve food, and we can have an informal discussion about your experience.</p>
                <p data-aos="fade-down">For the remainder of the day, it's important to avoid any significant obligations and allow yourself time for quiet reflection. To support your integration process, I recommend gentle activities such as journaling, meditating, walking, spending time in nature, and maintaining a simple, stress-free day.</p>

                        Everyone experiences the integration process differently. Some may feel a sense of joy and renewed energy, while others might experience emotional intensity and fatigue—or a combination of both. This is completely normal.
                    </p>
                    <p data-aos="fade-down">
                        What's important is that you give yourself the time and space to sit with whatever is coming up for you. Be gentle with yourself, and continue to maintain a clean diet. It’s also essential to avoid alcohol and cannabis for at least 24 hours following the ceremony. Additionally, large amounts of alcohol should be avoided for 7 days after receiving Kambo to allow for optimal healing.

                    <p data-aos="fade-down">
                        Take some time to deeply reflect on why you feel called to work with Kambo. Clearly define your intentions—what you are seeking to release and what you wish to invite into your life. In the days leading up to your ceremony, it can be helpful to meditate on your intention and hold it as a quiet prayer within yourself.
                    </p>
                    <p data-aos="fade-down">Participants are encouraged to avoid heavy, greasy, carb-heavy, and sugar-laden foods for at least 1-3 days prior to the ceremony. Foods containing processed vegetable oils, refined sugars, dairy, caffeine, and other junk foods with chemical additives should be avoided the day before and after your Kambo session.</p>
                    <p data-aos="fade-down">Alcohol must be avoided for 72 hours before the ceremony, and cannabis for at least 24 hours prior. Additionally, taking a break from mental stimulants such as social media and television can be very beneficial. This allows for a more focused and surrendered experience with Kambo, creating space for deeper healing and clarity.</p>

                    <p class="about-description" data-aos="fade-down">
                        Trina is an IAKP trained Kambo Facilitator, 5MEO-DMT Facilitator, Yoga Teacher, Astrologer, Reiki Master and World Traveler. She has been dedicated to the journey of personal transformation for over 12 years. Having tried many healing modalities her major breakthroughs came after discovering Kambo and the traditional earth medicine path. She was attracted to the straightforwardness and effectiveness of the Kambo process and used it to overcome depression and emotional trauma. Trina is passionate about helping others reach their highest potential by holding space for them to release the energies and toxins that block their inner light from shining through.
